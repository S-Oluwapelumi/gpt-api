Dear ENT Department
I am writing to refer this patient for your assessment. They have complained of an obstructed
nose worse following an injury playing rugby 6 weeks ago. He reports that the nose is no longer
symmetrical and he wonders whether this has contributed to his symptom. He has no history of
epistaxis, but has reported increased nasal discharge and sneezing.
Past Medical History: Eczema, Hay fever
No previous operations.
Current Medications: Topical hydrocortisone for eczema as needed, and Loratidine
He is a student and lives in student accommodation. He denies smoking and drugs and drinks
alcohol.
â€¢
Given the chronicity of the symptoms and potential for surgical correction, I feel an ENT review
would be valuable.
Warm regards,
Dr. Martin
