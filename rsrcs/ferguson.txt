Re: Geoffrey Ferguson, 1/4/1943
Dear ENT department
I am referring Geoffrey Ferguson due to a 5-month history of nasal blockage, primarily on the right
side. This has been accompanied by occasional tinnitus in the right ear with no loss of hearing.He
reports no pain or dizziness.
He has a history of hyperthyroidism, Meniereâ€™s disease, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
He takes Amlodipine 10mg daily, Carbimazole 10mg daily and Betahistine 16mg three times daily
as required. I have prescribed him a short course of nasal steroids for 2 weeks - Nasonex, but his
symptoms continue.
Given his symptoms, I request a comprehensive ENT assessment for Mr Ferguson.
Warm regards,
Dr. Johnson
