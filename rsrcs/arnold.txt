Dear ENT department
I am referring this patient for recurrent episodes of nasal obstruction over the past 8 months.
Alongside, he complains of snoring and interrupted sleep, possibly suggestive of sleep apnoea.
She reports no injuries or epistaxis, however she has noticed recent weight gain and headaches.
Past Medical History: Asthma; Allergic Rhinitis, High BMI
Current Medications: Salbutamol inhaler as needed; Cetirizine 10mg daily. She is allergic to
Penicillin.
I believe an ENT evaluation would be beneficial in determining the exact cause of his nasal
obstruction.
Warm regards,
Dr Turner
