Re: James McDonald, 233-532-4844, 16.8.1949
Dear ENT department
I am writing to refer my patient, James McDonald who has been experiencing persistent nasal
blockage for the past 6 months. The blockage seems to be unilateral, primarily on the left side.
He has spontaneous intermittent epistaxis from the left nostril which he is struggling to control.
Reduced sense of smell and no history of trauma. I have tried to reduce his Apixaban but the
symptoms persist.
â€¢
Past Medical History: Hypertension; Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; Atrial Fibrillation
Current Medications: Lisinopril 10mg OD; Metformin 500mg BD; Apixaban 2.5mg OD
He lives in a nursing home and is a former smoker and current alcohol drinker. He has no next of
kin.
Given the persistence and nature of the symptoms and the affect on his quality of life, I believe
further investigation by an ENT specialist would be appropriate. Thank you for your attention to
this matter.
Warm regards,
Dr Clark
