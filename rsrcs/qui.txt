Re: Hnin Qui, 2/3/1957, 343-235-3423
Dear ENT department,
I would like to refer the following patient. Mrs Qui has presented with sudden onset left facial pain
and persistent and repeated epistaxis. She claims to have difficulty swallowing and reports recent
weight loss.
She has no other past medical history, but her medical records are limited as she emigrated from
China 5 years ago.
She is a current smoker, works in a carpentry shop and drinks alcohol.
I would like her to be seen in ENT department to determine the nature of her symptoms.
Many thanks,
Dr. Gray
